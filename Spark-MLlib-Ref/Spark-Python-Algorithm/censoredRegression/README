censored_regression
===================

Linear regression with inequality constraints on some of the target values. Useful when you don't care about the specific value predicted
for some samples, only that's they're above some given value. 

Implementations for ordinary least-squares regression, as well as L1-penalized (Lasso) and L2-penalized (Ridge). 

Example usage:
```
	model = censored_regression.Lasso()
	# C is a boolean mask indicating which targets are lower bounds
	model.fit(X,Y,C)
	model.predict(X_test)
```
